# Application of SQL Skills in Carbon Emissions Analysis Project
In this project, I utilized my SQL skills to analyze and draw meaningful insights from a dataset related to global industrial carbon emissions. The dataset included variables such as industry name, country, year, CO₂ emissions, and GDP, offering a multivariate view of how different sectors contribute to environmental impact.
The project began with creating a structured relational database using SQL. I designed the schema to include relevant fields and ensured data integrity by selecting appropriate data types and constraints. I then imported a real-world dataset using bulk insert methods and validated the data using basic queries.
Once the database was set up, I applied advanced SQL techniques to explore patterns and trends. I used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions to calculate year-over-year emission changes per industry and country. This allowed me to identify sectors with growing emission trends and detect anomalies in the data. I also computed emissions-to-GDP ratios to evaluate industrial efficiency, ranking industries by their environmental impact relative to economic contribution.
GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOIN clauses were extensively used to aggregate data and compare emissions across countries and industries. I created views and summary tables to simplify repeated analysis and support potential dashboard integration.
To complement the SQL analysis, I integrated the database with Python via Google Colab. Using pandas, I executed SQL queries and visualized the results using matplotlib and seaborn. This helped in clearly communicating findings like the top polluting sectors, correlation patterns, and overall emission trends over time.
This project showcased my ability to handle real-world datasets, apply complex SQL logic, and transform raw data into actionable insights—skills that are crucial for data-driven roles in industry.
